Gareth Bale saw a goal disallowed as Barcelona and Real Madrid played
out a 0-0 draw at Camp Nou on Wednesday.

La Liga's top two went into the contest level on points this season and
with 72 wins each from previous league meetings, and there was nothing
to separate them in a tense clash in Catalonia.

The match was rearranged from October after the initial date became a
security risk due to the prospect of Catalan independence protests, and
there were fans inside and outside the stadium making their voices heard
over one of Spain's most divisive issues.

The action on the pitch was a little less fraught, Bale's second-half
strike - ruled out for offside - representing the closest either side
came to breaking the deadlock.

Madrid controlled the early exchanges and only Gerard Pique's timely
intervention on the line denied Casemiro an opening goal with a header.

Marc-Andre ter Stegen beat away another Casemiro effort after Madrid had
penalty shouts waved away following a shirt pull on Raphael Varane, who
had earlier squared up to Jordi Alba.

Thibaut Courtois went untested until the half-hour mark, when he palmed
away a teasing Alba cross and the covering Sergio Ramos cleared Lionel
Messi's rebound from in front of goal.

Alba had a golden chance to snatch the lead before half-time but could
only side-foot wide of the right-hand post following a sublime lofted
pass from Messi.

The second half proved more of an end-to-end affair, Bale rippling the
side-netting and then seeing celebrations cut short when his tap-in was
disallowed after a VAR review for an offside against Ferland Mendy.
